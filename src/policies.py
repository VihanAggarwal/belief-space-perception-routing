"""Phase 4: routing policies.

The centerpiece comparison (RQ-H) is JointPolicy vs DecoupledPolicy. Both consume
the SAME two belief signals (sensor-fault belief and compute-contention belief). The
only difference is whether the policy models the COUPLING between them:

  JointPolicy    fuses compute belief with a data-fit prediction of contention from
                 sensor-fault belief (the coupling term), so it can anticipate
                 contention at fault onset before the latency monitor reacts.
  DecoupledPolicy runs a sensor-driven choice and a compute-driven choice through
                 separate thresholds and combines them by a fixed "more conservative"
                 rule. It never uses one signal to predict the other.

The novel claim lives entirely in the delta between these two on deadline-miss rate,
and should appear in the coupled regime and shrink in the uncoupled regime. The
coupling coefficient is fit from data (~0 when faults do not predict contention), so
the decoupled baseline is a fair union, not a strawman.

Config cost order (most to least expensive): C1 > C3 > C2 > C4 by compute. We use a
"safer for the deadline" = cheaper ordering for the conservative combine rule.
